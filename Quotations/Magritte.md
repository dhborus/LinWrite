Magritte:
“If a dream is a revelation of waking life, waking life is also a revelation of a dream.”

“You can wonder about what is imagined and what is real. Is it about the reality of appearances or the appearance of reality? What really is inside, and what is outside? What do we have here: reality, or a dream? If a dream is a revelation of waking life, waking life is also a revelation of a dream.”
