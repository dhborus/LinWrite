### Regression and the Interpretation of Dreams  [[Brill_IOD]]

(#DQ) If we call the direction which the psychic process follows from the unconscious into the waking state progressive, we may then speak of the dream as having a regressive character.

Zaretsky comment -- human history implication -- not a single progressive surface but active layers "formed in the past to which we can return or *regress*.

Not progress versus decline as much as history unfolds at different levels and on different timescales-- points in the pass to which we regress, conflicts to which we return. [@zaretsky2017, p. 7-8]
