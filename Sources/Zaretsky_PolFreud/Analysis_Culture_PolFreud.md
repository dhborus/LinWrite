### Cultural importance of analysis

(#MP) freeing of individuals from unconscious images of authority; unconscious and sexuality itself reconceived as beyond social and family place. sleeper completely separated from real world [really? day residue? point of interpretation?] "No thought that comes to the individual --whether it originated in childhood or comes from the 'day residues' . . . -- is directly registered; rather it is first dissolved and internally reconstituted in such a way as to give it a unique and contingent meaning." Psychoanalysis interprets through divorce from collectivities, and relate more affirmatively to their depths. [@zaretsky2017, 21]
