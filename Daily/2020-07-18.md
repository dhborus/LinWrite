#police Conservatives, such as Bret Stephens, argue for the strengthening of the police by claiming that human nature has not changed -- that there will always be those who cheat, rob, kill, and so on. Consequently, we need the police to protect us. But if human nature does not change, we much also take account of the consequences of giving humans power on a life-and-death basis. to humans affected by the same human nature. "In the face of overwhelming evidence that giving human beings badges and guns and this kind of power over other human beings has led to corruption and brutality, people like Stephens retreat to denial and fantasy." #humanNature
