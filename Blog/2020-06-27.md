On Dreams or Freud 

Freud clearly has set pieces â€“ Dreams, psychiatrists, intellect, 50s therapy, not sure Dreams does in the same way. Clearly addresses for me the social v. individual as well as a politics of consciousness vs one of unconscious. Might be more complicated than first appeared. Certainly weightier than first appeared. Nonetheless, should probably proceed, at least for awhile, by alternating books. [Devon](x-devonthink-item://ACDE5EDE-9FB3-46D1-88B0-280A7EF0E399)
