Dear Craig:

Noticed on Twitter some irate Michigan fan cancelled his subscription over your Ohio State boosterism and your left-wing politics. As a former editor of the Michigan Daily (1973-74), I, of course, agree with his football loyalties and am shocked, shocked by your misbegotten Buckeye allegiance.

Since you’re a graduate of that god forsaken institution, I will make allowances. And, after all, it’s only football. I mean really. As for your politics, I’m here for that. Lord knows, we need a baseball writer who calls out the excesses and transgressions of the Lords of baseball. Expanding that critical eye to the Republicans in the Ohio legislature is from my vantage point is bonus.

Subscribing to Cup of Coffee has been in short the smartest media choice I’ve made in some time. Sure there’s Dylan commentary and Anna’s maps, but I especially like the essays from subscribers. While for some time I have been hearing all kinds of exaggerated claims about the glories of online, virtual communities, those pieces have made me realize how much I share with some fascinating and talented folks.

I should add in the spirit of full disclosure I am also a Cardinal fan. I am an old geezer who grew up before the “greatest fans” nonsense. I did attend Gibson’s 17 strikeout performance in 1968. Greatest sports event I ever saw. Better even than 24-12.

Thanks, Craig.

Best,

Dan Borus
