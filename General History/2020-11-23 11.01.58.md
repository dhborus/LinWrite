## *Vulture on Queen's Gambit Aesthetic*

If anything, the show’s distinctly Cold War vibes — good sportsmanship, beautiful dames, wreckage of empire — made me wonder if the pleasurable indulgence of this film was a sign that we are once again back in a Cold War. When the going gets tough in America, America responds by trying to feel good about itself. (This is the era of Peak Comfort TV, after all.) Think of the beach party movies, or, honestly, EPCOT. Period dramas typically represent the Cold War as an era of anxious dread, but cultural production during the actual Cold War more often sought to mitigate that sense of threat through good affect.
