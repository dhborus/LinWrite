On public goods

impressively stupid that candace can’t understand that public goods/services exist to benefit her if she needs them, but exist without her personally needing them to exist. yes, roads are public. no, we’re not gonna cancel route 66 because candace never plans to drive on it.

candace’s argument falls in the same family as hillary’s objections to a free public option for college on the basis that rich would use it. therefore: decrease the program’s inclusiveness & generosity to accommodate a rich minority.

it’s a bullshit conservative argument that tried to limit the political meaning of “public” to goods/services that must benefit no one if they can’t benefit everyone. in a deeply unequal economy like ours, this lets the rich who need nothing dictate a stingy welfare policy.

[mirror image -- public goods should exist if everyone needs them. Rich do not need college, therefore program should not exist]
