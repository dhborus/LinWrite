# # On the realities of baseball (from Ruth Kapelus, Jewish South African Canadian reader of Calcaterra)


Again, my cynicism rose. As happy as I am for Ng, I worry for her. For how incredible she will have to be at this job to keep the door open for other women. There are countless women qualified to do this job. But there is still the belief that men; frankly, white men, are innately qualified to work in sports. Everyone else needs to ‘prove’ their way in. These men never need to ‘earn’ their place - it’s granted to them.

MLB’s statement on Ng’s hiring said this was an example for women and girls everywhere - and it’s not. It’s a lesson for men. But it’s not one I’m confident that enough of the right men will learn.

And this is just one end of the misogyny spectrum in baseball. That the punishment for using steroids is automatic and often much harsher than for a player who commits domestic violence speaks volumes. And always the argument that PEDs harm the game more than a criminal act of violence against a woman. Harming us doesn’t harm the ‘game’. What message does that send women and non-binary people about our worth and place in baseball.
