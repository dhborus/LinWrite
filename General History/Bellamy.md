*Looking Backward* is a Utopian novel -- Utopian novels imagine what a good or ideal society would look like. Often criticized for being unrealistic and for emphasizing principles that are undesirable or even, in some cases, harmful or detrimental.

Bellamy's one of the most famous American versions. Tremendous influence – all kinds of political movements and political thinkers were influenced or borrowed from it. Including late nineteenth century feminists. 

Response to what we call industrialization. Nineteenth century time of great economic growth – made possible by use of machines. Enabled things to be produced in greater quantities less expensively, but brought renewed poverty, insecurity, physical danger, and conflict. That conflict between workers and employers could be bloody and government intervened (overwhelmingly on side of owners.) Strikes constant. 1877 seemed like an actual civil war. 

Might see then Bellamy's book as a way to imagine a new future that eliminated conflict, poverty, and insecurity of an industrial society. Key is setting forth a cooperative society.  Built on obligation and equal social provisioning. Assumes people will work because society needs it, will have in return for putting forth best effort (regardless of how efficient or productive) goods and services necessary for a productive and creative life. Single employer -- the nation -- and single seller -- also the nation. Eliminates the force and fraud, many saw as the basis of post Civil War economics. 

In some ways, will seem out of date. Was, after all, kind of prediction. Set in 2000, though written in 1887. 2000 definitely not what Bellamy predicted. But because of Covid and Black Lives Matter, issues Bellamy raised, continue to be relevant. Should we have a cooperative society? Can we have one? If we can't, why not?And if we should and can have a cooperative society, on what do we cooperate and what does it mean for us as individuals? 

Not a perfect book. Can see some of the things that he missed. But I think as we talk about why we should wear masks, how we should respond to the unemployed during the Covid crisis, what kind of provisioning, if any, should be social, Bellamy's response seem worth considering. .
