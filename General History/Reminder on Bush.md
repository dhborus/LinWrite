Reminder of Bush


From its first days in office, the Bush Administration has made clear its determination to reverse as much as possible of the modest progress made in the 20th century toward public provision for the unfortunate; public encouragement of worker, consumer, and neighborhood selforganization; public influence on the daily operation of government and access to the record of its activities; public protection of the commons; and public restraint of concentrated financial and corporate power—not only at home but also, to the (considerable, given American influence) extent feasible, abroad.


You would need more than that just for a preface to an adequate critique of the lies of the Bush Administration. As the journalist Paul Waldman has remarked, “Bush tells more lies about policy in a week than Bill Clinton did in eight years.” He has lied about taxes, budgets, and deficits; about employment statistics; about veterans’ benefits; about the Social Security trust fund and the costs of privatization; about climate change; about environmental policy; about oil drilling in the Arctic; about the California electricity crisis; about stem-cell research; about Enron and Harken; about the Florida recount in November 2000; about his National Guard service and his record as governor of Texas; and about most of his political opponents. And then there are his lies about Iraq. The Bush Administration is the most ambitiously and skillfully dishonest pack of liars in American history, probably by a large margin. And since 9/11, Hitchens has never said a mumbling word about it.
