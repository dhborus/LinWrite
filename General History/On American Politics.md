It's depressing but not unsurprising that people in media think of political power almost exclusively in terms of "exposing" politicians "real positions" to voters, as if the voters A) would notice B) would care or C) have any means to do anything about it.

We just elected Trump and let 300k die from COVID. Millions more are in severe economic crisis. This system and its politicians are more "exposed" than they have ever been in my lifetime! We aren't lacking exposure to the problem, we're lacking organized vehicles to change it.[@hofstadter1955, p. 55.]
