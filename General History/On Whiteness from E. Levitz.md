###  on Whiteness from e. Levitz


Attempts to stigmatize "whiteness" are progressive if white identity is understood as an oppressive fiction ppl can opt into or out of. Casting "White" as a legit ethnicity people are born into would seem to aid those who wish to discredit left racial discourse as reverse racism.
