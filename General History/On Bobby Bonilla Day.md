From Craig Calcaterra:

I love a good “LOL Mets!” joke more than your average person, but I’ve never gotten on board with mocking the Mets for paying Bonilla each July 1. Mostly because the deal was and is not really silly at all. Indeed, there are far, far worse deferred compensation deals around.

Here’s the bullet point version:

Essentially this is deferred compensation. Deferred compensation was not super common 20 years ago but it’s par for the course on big contracts now. Max Scherzer’s seven-year deal with the Nats pays him over 14 years and he’ll be making WAY more per year after he’s done pitching than Bonilla will in his 25 years of deferred money combined. There are many, many other players who have signed big deals in recent years who have similar structures.

One of the things that makes Bonilla’s deal stick out is the interest he’s getting: 8%. That’s high, but as The Bad Economist pointed out a few years back, the prime rate when Bonilla signed the deal was 8.5%. The Mets probably should’ve made his interest a floating figure rather than fixing it at 8% — Bonilla is getting a windfall on the interest — but that’s down to the Mets’ owners’ well-documented bad financial instincts and their misguided belief that they’d make 10-15% on their investments in perpetuity based on the Ponzi scheme from which they were benefitting, not the silliness of the structure itself.

The Mets got use of the $5.9 million Bonilla deferred for years. And, legal or not, they probably DID get 15% on it because the Ponzi scheme hadn’t collapsed yet. But even if they had put that in a totally legal, interest-bearing account, they would’ve made money on it. They got something for it. Even conservatively invested, a good half of the $30 million or so Bonilla is getting after interest will have been paid for.

And they got more than just the investment. As Dan Lewis pointed out five years ago, the $5.9 that was freed up for 2000 was used to bite off a huge chunk of the salaries owed to Mike Hampton and Derek Bell, for whom they traded and who helped them reach the World Series that year. When Hampton walked to take advantage of the good schools in the Denver area, they used the compensation pick to draft a kid named David Wright. None of that happens without deferring Bonilla’s salary given their payroll crunch at the time. It ended up working for them in the short term, and working very well.
