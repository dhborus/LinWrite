Thoughts on McGovernism

This is both political and personal. The book is an effort to understand what on its surface seems to be a strange trajectory of McGovern and his staff from the most left-wing tendency in mainstream electoral politics to a generally immovable bulwark of Democratic centrism made up of unquestioned support for "unregulated" markets, incrementalism, and a form of social liberalism predominates. Very much seems a matter of class, of the ways in which PMC has shifted. Not simply a matter of personal failures to maintain radicalism.

Every Buttigieg sentence is just him saying some word and its opposite in close succession, to simulate the feeling of poetry, not that of prose. The man is an empty suit, and full of shit.
