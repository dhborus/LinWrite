From Timothy Burke on Paul Krugman's comments on 9/11 reaction:

And you know what? Those ideal figures--like many of the signers of such letters--is typically stubborn as all hell, doing nothing like dialogue, and mostly sees the public sphere as a megaphone through which he gets to shout at everyone and get paid for it. 2/

You're not going to read from Krugman or any of his ilk anything like dialogue. Never a "that's a great point" or "I've really learned something today" or "Interesting, and I clearly need to rethink some of my own impressions". That's not what public reason means to them.

NYT: we love it
