### More Thoughts on Linux Sat Mar 20 06:52:34 AM EDT 2021

Things are missing, I suppose, but I don't do the high end stuff -- just surfing, research, writing. Was going to go with iPad, but still can't use pandoc on the device. Could have used Scrivener with Dropbox. (wonder if NextCloud would work), but there is something reassuring about plain text.

Thinkpad purchase? -- hmm. So far MacBook Pro working well with Manjaro. Not sure it is worth it for a more conducive keyboard. (At moment wondering why bpytop is not running.) Maybe 15" as base; 13" as mobile? Maybe. Insures iPad is a consumption machine.

Would want to find some use for keyboard. So maybe monitor as the purchase. At least we can try out Karen's discarded monitor with the 15" Pro. Or 13" with monitor for one-stop computing.
