## On Notes

**Stage One**: Begin with Source Notes with publication information and a summary.

Add notes of date, title, content, tags, links.

File Title: Author_Short Book Title

### Subnotes Date-Time_NoteName

Note: Now is the time for all good people to come to the aid of their party.[@wall2008]

Tags:

Links: [[EZ_PF]] [[20200714]]

Separate Notes for Concepts (explanations of central ideas, processes, events) and Quotations (for quotations that might be used in my text)

Notes should concentrate on new information that would contradict, support, or supplement what I already know.

When finished, write thesis statement, Add tags and links (sources that make similar points or deal with similar arguments)

**Stage Two:** Dreams/Shrink -- Be on the look out for how ideas combine and whether I have new reactions or questions.

Cull Primary notes for Insights -- statements in own words. Place  in Dreams or Shrink folders. These will be the building blocks of writing.

Title will be Major Ideas and Number: 001_Dream_Symbols

Note will have rewriting -- link to source note section -- tag and page for central idea. [[GibsonNotes]] #baseball

Create bibliography page for finished books.

**Stage Three:** Zettlr with Obsidian in other half of screen (will work even better in iMac). Could do so with Obsidian but it is not set up to be an academic writing app. Doesn't do much with footnotes or Pandoc.

Might bring Scrivener back. (probably not since it is not currently functioning on the iMac with Big Sur)


**Random Observations**Obsidian links with DevonThink [Corporate Irresponsibility](x-devonthink-item://47B1D21F-B072-4016-9182-B5D26EAF878E)
 doesn't seem to work. Atom and Zettlr don'tÂ -- Zettlr indicates devonthink-item not entered in launch services.

 Obsidian talks with Atom, but not Zettlr, when the link has directory-name. Talks with Zettlr, but not Atom, when link is name with no directory.

 [University of Rochester](https://www.rochester.edu) does work.

 iA Writer does not work with wikilinks -- thus less likely to be app for IPad. IWriter does, but may not be as efficient.

 With the coming of Big Sur, eventually will move to iMac. At moment, little iCloud. Stored on Documents and GitHub (Atom)
 
 **Block Links**
 
 ### Link to blocks

To link to a block in a specific file, first type `[[filename` to bring up a list of matched files. After selecting a file, type `^` and continue typing to search for blocks to link to.

Once you hit enter, a link to that block will be generated for you, in the format similar to `[[filename#^dcf64c]]`, where `dcf64c` is the block ID that was just generated for you.

If you're not sure which file the block is in, another method is to type `[[^^` and search for blocks in all files. This will search through all the blocks in your vault, so expect a bit of delay if your vault is large.

For example, [^dcf64c](https://publish.obsidian.md/help/How+to/Link+to+blocks#^dcf64c) is a link to a block above.[@boyd2003]
