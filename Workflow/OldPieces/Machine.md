Very few of my work apps are OS-dependent. Atom, Zettlr, pandoc-latex, Obsidian, Firefox, and Bitwarden are all plain text or available on different platforms. So the issue becomes do I want to avoid the Apple markup and hardware costs or stay within the eco-system taking advantage of the silicon revolution? Linux is solid and workable (even a bit faster) while Apple is shiny and "just works."

There is a third choice: use MacOS on old Apple hardware. Have generally rejected it on the grounds that eventually Apple will move things to silicon and the 2012 Pro will need replacement (already the battery is incapable of sessions longer than an hour and a half).

As an aside, it is interesting the way that a fourth option – purchasing used Intel PC is not minimally attractive. At least with the inexpensive ones. As much as I have railed against thinness from Apple, I nonetheless seem to want to avoid chunky models and with present-day Lenovo, Dell, and AMD models the prices are so similar to the Mac, I may as well use a Mac.

Karen's use of the iMac has meant that my machine will be in all likelihood a laptop, supplemented by an external drive. iPad-iPhone will be primarily the consumption machines. I could get a mac mini (M1) and use iPad as the mobile machine. That would open the way for mechanical keyboard use and keep me in the ecosystem. But that option would entail synchronization and **one advantage of a laptop is that it allows me to take my work anywhere without synchronization but with backup.**

So until June, the question is whether Linux will suffice. Can I communicate, research, write, and prepare for publication? Can I find replacements for Alfred, Keyboard Maestro, and MS Word? Can I learn Manjaro shortcuts? If yes, the test becomes whether the 13" is usable. Key will be how well the battery lasts (the 15” works worse with Linux than with MacOS) and how the screen looks at that size.

If Linux will not work, the question is whether the 13” or a silicon laptop will be the machine of choice. If I opt for Apple silicon, then sale or donation of old laptops.

Update 2021-03-23--Ran into some difficulties with Obsidian-Zettlr-Atom but Atom's versatility may in fact save it. Started off with the iPad and Brydge keyboard, which seemed cool enough, forgetting for the moment the difficulties with both charging and synchronization. Obsidian does not produce links in single words any longer -- or at least for the moment a link is folder-title. Which is fine enough.

Similarly, shortcuts seem less direct than mac and keyboard maestro. Autokey is okay but not Mac-like quality. [[Daily/2021-03-23]]
