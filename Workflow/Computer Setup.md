2. shift option command v no formatting paste;
3. option command v in destination folder for move
4. shift-command-backslash for move-copy through Alfred
5. Firefox produces two windows when opened through clicking on link; drag and drop merges.
6. for Terminal pandoc instead of --filter=pandoc-citeproc simply --citeproc
7. YAML allows Zettlr to create PDF. Control-Option-Command Y

### Note-Taking Form
[[Workflow/Note-Taking]]

Probably worrying too much about notes and not enough about direction, point, and purpose of the reading. Need to do more summary. In fact, might be important to do that in Kindle.

1. **Kindle and PDF Notes**

Every highlight has an attached note. Those for interesting facts and points – will probably have simple NB or central argument. Some may have more extensive challenges or ideas.


2. **Books and Articles**

Date, Note, Citation, Tags, Links

Zettlr search works for all tags and linked files within a given folder. Command-click.

### Example:
FreudOnKites_IOD

Date: 17 June 2020

Note: Contrary to expectations, held that kite dreams signaled sexual frustration, not liberation.
