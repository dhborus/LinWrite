# Distro

The general Linux question is whether I can comfortably do my work and use the computer as I more or less use a Mac. There is, of course, much to learn, and so it appeals to my acquire skills inclinations. But it also will mean that I remove myself from the shiny, just works world of Apple. The development of silicon and Big Sur and beyond means that the mac collection in the house will eventually become obsolete at worst and "laggy" at best. The virtue of Linux is that it will extend the life of my current machines and save me money. This result makes even more sense given that I do not do heavy work (video, photos, music) but surf and research, take notes and write. Yes, there's streaming but not so much as to tax the machine. Linux makes sense for those things, even with a steep learning curve.

As for the distribution, I have solved many of the Manjaro problems -- screen fonts (16X9 rather than X10), email, Dropbox, Autokey usage, update, Zotero picker rather than autocomplete, Mint is solid but it isn't very exciting. Manjaro has great software repositories, although Debian-based distros and easier to learn. Someday may switch to Garuda, but it is flashier but not necessarily better to use.

Elementary probably is the better backup for Manjaro. It has the Debian base and will allow for Mac-like gestures, shortcuts, and snippets. It too is solid, I think, in a way Majaro is not.
